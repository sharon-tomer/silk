# Silk.security coding assignment
## By Tomer Sharon

To run the project in dev env:
```yarn && yarn dev```

To run the project in production:
pay me ;) j/k, just don't.

Things that were left out of scope due to the small size of the project:
- state management lib
- routing
- security, sanitization & permissions
- abstractions and componentization
- optimizations (lazy loading, dynamic imports, package size etc)
- smaller monitor support
- fancy, pixel-perfect UI
