# Silk.security coding assignment
## By Tomer Sharon

Hey Or,
Nice to almost meet you.
Here's my submission of the assignment Yoav gave me a couple of days ago.
I choose to code the front-end assignment because it felt like a good opportunity to take next.js for a spin, but I consider myself a full-stack engineer.
Note that I've shamelessly stolen your company logo and color pallet, I hope that's fine.
Please feel free to contact me if anything is unclear or doesn't run on your machine.

To run in dev env:
```yarn && yarn dev```

To run in production:
pay me ;) j/k, just don't.

A partial list of things I thought about briefly and decided to leave out of scope:
- state management lib
- routing
- security, sanitization & permissions
- abstractions and componentization
- optimizations (caching, lazy loading, dynamic imports, package size etc)
- smaller monitor/multi-platform support
- fancy, pixel-perfect UI
- user area (cookies, auth, session)
