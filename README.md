# Silk.security coding assignment

Hey Bar,
Nice to almost meet you.
Here's my submission of the assignment Yoav gave me a couple of days ago.
I choose to code the front-end assignment because it felt like a good opportunity to take next.js for a spin, but I consider myself a full-stack engineer.
Note that I've shamelessly stolen your company logo and color pallet, I hope that's fine.
Please feel free to contact me if anything is unclear or doesn't run on your machine.

To run in dev env:
```yarn && yarn dev```

To run in production:
pay me ;) j/k, just don't.

A partial list of things I thought about briefly and decided to leave out of scope:
- State management lib
- Routing
- Security, sanitization & permissions
- Abstractions and componentization
- Optimizations (caching, lazy loading, dynamic imports, package size etc)
- Smaller monitor/multi-platform support
- User area (cookies, auth, session)

However, if you do want me to implement some of these, let me know.

Cheers,
Tomer
